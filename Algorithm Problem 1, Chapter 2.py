#Algorithm Workbench
#Problem 1: Write Python code that prompts the user to enter his or her height and assigns the user's input to a variable named *height*.


#First, we have to create a input for the user to put down their favorite color. To do this, we use an input function.
#We then set the results of the user to the variable "color", so we can use the results as we please.
#Then, to confirm that the program worked, I used a print function to output the result of what we put into the program.
#In essence, we are entering an input, and expecting an output that is the same as the input.

color = input("What color do you want?")
print(color)
